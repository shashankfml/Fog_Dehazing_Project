# Fog_Dehazing_Project

## üìå Overview
Dense fog is one of the most critical challenges faced by Indian Railways, especially during the winter months in North India. Reduced visibility impacts train safety, punctuality, and operational efficiency. Traditional aids such as detonators, FogPASS, and GPS-based systems provide partial solutions but do not fully address dynamic hazard detection in extreme weather.

This repository documents:
- A **literature survey** of fog-handling techniques used by Indian Railways.
- The **current state of the art**, including Kavach 4.0.
- A **proposed multimodal fog dehazing system** leveraging LiDAR, RADAR, and thermal cameras for 3D reconstruction and obstacle detection in low-visibility scenarios.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Historical Handling of Fog in Indian Railways

### Early Methods
- **Detonators (Fog Signals):** Small explosive devices placed on the track that produce a loud bang when a train passes over them. These warned drivers of signals ahead in poor visibility.
- **Hand-held lamps and flags:** Station staff used manual signaling in extreme conditions.
- **Speed restrictions:** Blanket restrictions were imposed in fog-prone areas.

### GPS-Based Aids
- **FogPASS (Fog Pilot Assistance System for Safety):**
  - A GPS-based portable device that alerts loco pilots about approaching signals, level crossings, and stations.
  - Provided audio/visual cues during low-visibility conditions.
  - Reduced dependency on manual systems but limited to fixed infrastructure alerts.
  - **Limitation:** Could not detect *dynamic hazards* (obstructions, animals, broken tracks).

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Latest Solutions & Ground Reality

### FogPASS Deployment
- Widely deployed across multiple zones.
- Helps in maintaining punctuality and reducing human error in fog.
- **Limitation:** Does not address real-time detection of unexpected obstacles.

### Kavach (Train Collision Avoidance System)
- Kavach is an indigenous Automatic Train Protection (ATP) system designed to prevent collisions and signal passing at danger (SPAD).
- Provides communication between trains, trackside equipment, and control centers.
- Current rollout in phases; Kavach 4.0 is the latest version.

**Ground Reality:**
- FogPASS helps but does not eliminate delays or hazards.
- Kavach primarily addresses train-train and signal-related safety but does not solve visibility challenges for *dynamic hazards* on tracks.
- There remains an operational gap in *real-time hazard perception*.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Kavach 4.0 & Relevance

- **What is Kavach 4.0?**
  - Advanced version of India‚Äôs ATP.
  - Enforces speed restrictions, prevents SPAD, and improves safety via RFID, GPS, and radio communication.
- **Relation to Fog Dehazing:**
  - Kavach ensures safety at the signaling and control layer.
  - A fog dehazing system acts as a **complementary perception layer**, detecting real-time hazards and providing inputs to the loco pilot (and potentially Kavach in the future).
  - Together, they can provide end-to-end safety in adverse weather.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Global Approaches to Fog & Low-Visibility Railway Operations

### Techniques Used Worldwide
- **Thermal Cameras:** Detect humans, animals, and vehicles obscured by fog.
- **Millimeter-Wave Radar:** Penetrates fog and rain, reliable for long-range detection.
- **LiDAR with Fog-Tuned Parameters:** Provides 3D mapping, though degraded in dense fog.
- **Sensor Fusion Approaches:**
  - Combining RADAR + LiDAR + Thermal for robust obstacle detection.
  - AI/ML models trained for adverse-weather perception.
- **Driver Assistance Displays:** Augmented reality HUDs and auditory alerts.

**Best Practice:** Multimodal sensor fusion is the most reliable approach in adverse conditions.

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Proposed Fog Dehazing System

### Objectives
- Real-time detection of dynamic obstacles (animals, humans, broken tracks).
- Enhanced situational awareness for loco pilots.
- Complementary safety layer to Kavach 4.0.

### System Architecture
1. **Sensors**
   - Long-range mmWave RADAR.
   - LiDAR (fog-optimized).
   - Long-wave infrared (LWIR) thermal cameras.
   - Auxiliary RGB camera (clear weather only).
2. **Processing**
   - Multimodal sensor fusion.
   - 3D reconstruction for obstacle localization.
   - AI-based dehazing + detection pipeline.
3. **Outputs**
   - Human-Machine Interface (HMI) with concise alerts (audio + minimal visual).
   - Geo-tagged logs for operational analytics.
   - Optional integration with Kavach data feeds (future).

### Benefits
- Detects both fixed and dynamic hazards.
- Provides redundancy in extreme weather.
- Increases confidence of loco pilots during fog operations.

### Limitations & Considerations
- LiDAR degradation in dense fog (requires fusion).
- False positives must be minimized to avoid overloading drivers.
- Certification with RDSO/IRISET required before integration with Kavach.
- Crew training and HMI usability testing are critical.

## üöÜ Conclusion
Fog has been a persistent challenge for Indian Railways, historically managed through detonators, speed restrictions, and more recently, GPS-based FogPASS. While Kavach 4.0 significantly improves operational safety, it does not address real-time dynamic obstacle detection in low visibility. A **multimodal fog dehazing system using RADAR, LiDAR, and thermal cameras** can fill this gap and act as a complementary safety layer, enhancing reliability and saving lives.
