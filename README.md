# Fog_Dehazing_Project

# Vision-Based Fog & Extreme Weather Perception System

## üå´Ô∏è Motivation
Adverse weather conditions such as **dense fog, snow, and low visibility** severely impact transportation safety and defense operations.  
- In **urban mobility and autonomous driving**, fog drastically reduces the reliability of computer vision systems.  
- In **Indian Railways**, dense winter fog in **Delhi, Punjab, Haryana, and Uttar Pradesh** disrupts thousands of train services annually.  
- In **extreme terrains like Kashmir and the Northeast**, soldiers face reduced visibility in snowstorms and fog, affecting convoy safety and surveillance.  

This project unifies **state-of-the-art research on vision under foggy conditions** with **real-world deployment needs of Indian Railways and defense logistics**.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Literature from Computer Vision Research

Research led by **Christos Sakaridis (ETH Zurich)** has been pivotal in addressing perception under fog:

- **Semantic Foggy Scene Understanding (2018, IJCV):**  
  - Introduced **Foggy Cityscapes** (20k synthetic foggy images) and **Foggy Driving** (real foggy dataset).  
  - Demonstrated that **semi-supervised learning** with synthetic + real fog improves semantic segmentation and detection.  
  - Key insight: *Dehazing alone is insufficient ‚Äî models must learn directly under fog conditions.*

- **Curriculum Model Adaptation (CMAda, 2019):**  
  - Proposed gradual adaptation from **light synthetic fog ‚Üí dense real fog**.  
  - Released **Foggy Zurich** dataset (~3.8k real foggy images).  
  - Key insight: Curriculum learning with fog density estimation helps models generalize better in real fog.

- **Foggy Synscapes (2019):**  
  - Fully synthetic dataset (25k high-quality foggy scenes).  
  - Showed that **purely synthetic fog data** can outperform partially synthetic approaches when adapting to real fog.  
  - Key insight: Large-scale synthetic fog datasets are powerful for training robust perception models.

**Takeaway for us:**  
- Pure RGB dehazing is not enough.  
- **Synthetic + real fog datasets, curriculum adaptation, and multimodal fusion** are the most reliable strategies for perception under fog.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Extreme Weather Challenges in India

### **Railways (Dense Fog in the North)**
- **Regions:** Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Bihar ‚Äî among the most fog-affected globally.  
- **Current Solutions:**  
  - *Detonators, manual signaling, speed restrictions* (historical).  
  - *FogPASS (GPS-based alerts)* ‚Üí helps with fixed landmarks but **cannot detect dynamic hazards**.  
  - *Kavach 4.0 (ATP system)* ‚Üí prevents collisions and SPADs, but does **not solve visibility for loco pilots**.  
- **Operational Gap:** No current system can provide **real-time obstacle detection under fog**.

### **Military Operations (Kashmir & Northeast)**
- **Scenarios:**  
  - Convoys in mountain passes with fog/snow.  
  - Border patrols in whiteout/blizzard conditions.  
  - UAV/ground robot navigation in low visibility.  
- **Current Issues:**  
  - Conventional vision sensors fail in fog/snow.  
  - Thermal cameras help but lack depth.  
  - Radar is robust but low-resolution.  
- **Operational Gap:** Need for **multimodal perception (Radar + LiDAR + Thermal)** for robust navigation and surveillance.
